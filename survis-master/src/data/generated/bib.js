        "abstract": "With the rapid evolution of financial technology (FinTech) the importance of analyzing financial transactions is growing in importance. As the prevalence and number of financial transactions grow, so does the necessity of visual analysis tools to study the behavior represented by these transactions. However, real bank transaction data is generally private for security and confidentiality reasons, thus preventing its use for visual analysis and research. We present MoneyData, an anonymized open bank data set spanning seven years worth of transactions for research and analysis purposes. To our knowledge, this is the first real-world retail bank transaction data that has been anonymized and made public for visualization and analysis by other researchers. We describe the data set, its characteristics, and the anonymization process and present some preliminary analysis and images as a starting point for future research. The transactions are also categorized to facilitate understanding. We believe the availability of this open data will greatly benefit the research community and facilitate further study of finance.",

        "abstract": "Online news tools - for aggregation, summarization and automatic generation - are an area of fruitful development as reading news online becomes increasingly commonplace. While textual tools have dominated these developments, annotated information visualizations are a promising way to complement articles based on their ability to add context. But the manual effort required for professional designers to create thoughtful annotations for contextualizing news visualizations is difficult to scale. We describe the design of Contextifier, a novel system that automatically produces custom, annotated visualizations of stock behavior given a news article about a company. Contextifier's algorithms for choosing annotations is informed by a study of professionally created visualizations and takes into account visual salience, contextual relevance, and a detection of key events in the company's history. In evaluating our system we find that Contextifier better balances graphical salience and relevance than the baseline.",

        "abstract": "Market participants and businesses have made tremendous efforts to make the best decisions in a timely manner under varying economic and business circumstances. As such, decision-making processes based on Financial data have been a popular topic in industries. However, analyzing Financial data is a non-trivial task due to large volume, diversity and complexity, and this has led to rapid research and development of visualizations and visual analytics systems for Financial data exploration. Often, the development of such systems requires researchers to collaborate with Financial domain experts to better extract requirements and challenges in their tasks. Work to systematically study and gather the task requirements and to acquire an overview of existing visualizations and visual analytics systems that have been applied in Financial domains with respect to real-world data sets has not been completed. To this end, we perform a comprehensive survey of visualizations and visual analytics. In this work, we categorize Financial systems in terms of data sources, applied automated techniques, visualization techniques, interaction, and evaluation methods. For the categorization and characterization, we utilize existing taxonomies of visualization and interaction. In addition, we present task requirements extracted from interviews with domain experts in order to help researchers design better systems with detailed goals.",

        "abstract": "Visualization, a vibrant field for researchers, practitioners, and higher educational institutions, is growing and evolving very rapidly. Tremendous progress has been made since 1987, the year often cited as the beginning of data visualization as a distinct field. As such, the number of visualization resources and the demand for those resources is increasing at a rapid pace. After a decades-equivalent long search process, we present a survey of open visualization resources for all those with an interest in interactive data visualization and visual analytics. Because the number of resources is so large, we focus on collections of resources, of which there are already many ranging from literature collections to collections of practitioner resources. Based on this, we develop a classification of visualization resource collections with a focus on the resource type, e.g. literature-based, web-based, developer focused and special topics. The result is an overview and details-on-demand of many useful resources. The collection offers a valuable jump-start for those seeking out data visualization resources from all backgrounds spanning from beginners such as students to teachers, practitioners, developers, and researchers wishing to create their own advanced or novel visual designs. This paper is a response to students and others who frequently ask for visualization resources available to them.",

        "abstract": "Information visualization as a field is growing rapidly in popularity since the first information visualization conference in 1995. However, as a consequence of its growth, it is increasingly difficult to follow the growing body of literature within the field. Survey papers and literature reviews are valuable tools for managing the great volume of previously published research papers, and the quantity of survey papers in visualization has reached a critical mass. To this end, this survey paper takes a quantum step forward by surveying and classifying literature survey papers in order to help researchers understand the current landscape of Information Visualization. It is, to our knowledge, the first survey of survey papers (SoS) in Information Visualization. This paper classifies survey papers into natural topic clusters which enables readers to find relevant literature and develops the first classification of classifications. The paper also enables researchers to identify both mature and less developed research directions as well as identify future directions. It is a valuable resource for both newcomers and experienced researchers in and outside the field of Information Visualization and Visual Analytics.",

        "abstract": "Information visualization is a rapidly evolving field with a growing volume of scientific literature and texts continually published. To keep abreast of the latest developments in the domain, survey papers and state-of-the-art reviews provide valuable tools for managing the large quantity of scientific literature. Recently, a survey of survey papers was published to keep track of the quantity of refereed survey papers in information visualization conferences and journals. However, no such resources exist to inform readers of the large volume of books being published on the subject, leaving the possibility of valuable knowledge being overlooked. We present the first literature survey of information visualization books that addresses this challenge by surveying the large volume of books on the topic of information visualization and visual analytics. This unique survey addresses some special challenges associated with collections of books (as opposed to research papers) including searching, browsing and cost. This paper features a novel two-level classification based on both books and chapter topics examined in each book, enabling the reader to quickly identify to what depth a topic of interest is covered within a particular book. Readers can use this survey to identify the most relevant book for their needs amongst a quickly expanding collection. In indexing the landscape of information visualization books, this survey provides a valuable resource to both experienced researchers and newcomers in the data visualization discipline.",

        "abstract": "A rapidly increasing number of businesses rely on visualisation solutions for their data management challenges. This demand stems from an industry-wide shift towards data-driven approaches to decision making and problem-solving. However, there is an overwhelming mass of heterogeneous data collected as a result. The analysis of these data become a critical and challenging part of the business process. Employing visual analysis increases data comprehension thus enabling a wider range of users to interpret the underlying behaviour, as opposed to skilled but expensive data analysts. Widening the reach to an audience with a broader range of backgrounds creates new opportunities for decision making, problem-solving, trend identification, and creative thinking. In this survey, we identify trends in business visualisation and visual analytic literature where visualisation is used to address data challenges and identify areas in which industries use visual design to develop their understanding of the business environment. Our novel classification of literature includes the topics of businesses intelligence, business ecosystem, customer-centric. This survey provides a valuable overview and insight into the business visualisation literature with a novel classification that highlights both mature and less developed research directions.",

Despite modern stock market platforms and research tools offering a range of stock data and visual analysis software, retail investment data is difficult to find due to privacy and security concerns. This challenge poses barriers to researchers and analysts interested in portfolio management, analysis, and visualization. This paper introduces StockVis, the first open and anonymized dataset of investment transactions. This freely accessible dataset can be used to study investment portfolio analysis, thereby improving strategic decisionmaking in portfolio management. StockVis features a comprehensive set of investment transactions focused on the U.S. stock market, encompassing the transaction records of an anonymous investor over 3-4 years, complemented by derived metadata on the stocks of interest. We provide an overview of the dataset, detailing its features and the process of anonymization, and present some initial analyses and visualization images as a foundation for further study. We are confident that the accessibility of this open data will significantly contribute to the research community, fostering enhanced exploration in the field of investment.",

        "abstract": "Mutual funds are becoming increasingly popular with the emergence of Internet finance. Clear profiling of a fund's investment style is crucial for fund managers to evaluate their investment strategies, and for investors to understand their investment. However, it is challenging to profile a fund's investment style as it requires a comprehensive analysis of complex multi-dimensional temporal data. In addition, different fund managers and investors have different focuses when analysing a fund's investment style. To address the issue, we propose iFUNDit, an interactive visual analytic system for fund investment style analysis. The system decomposes a fund's critical features into performance attributes and investment style factors, and visualizes them in a set of coupled views: a fund and manager view, to delineate the distribution of funds' and managers' critical attributes on the market; a cluster view, to show the similarity of investment styles between different funds; and a detail view, to analyse the evolution of fund investment style. The system provides a holistic overview of fund data and facilitates a streamlined analysis of investment style at both the fund and the manager level. The effectiveness and usability of the system are demonstrated through domain expert interviews and case studies by using a real mutual fund dataset.",
